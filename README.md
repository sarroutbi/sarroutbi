# Sergio Arroutbi (sarroutbi)

Hi there üëã. I am a Software developer working at [Red Hat Inc](https://www.redhat.com/).  I love [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) üêß Operating System and work essentially for [RHEL Operating System](https://www.redhat.com/es/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and [OpenShift Platform](https://github.com/openshift). I mostly work on projects related to [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053), although lately I am starting to work on [Keylime](https://keylime.dev/) project.

In the past, I have worked in different industries such as Information Technology, Telecommunication and Semiconductor industries, for companies such as [Telef√≥nica](https://telefonica.es), [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com), [Motorola](https://motorola.com), [Ericsson](https://ericsson.com) and [Marvell](https://www.marvell.com).

I have experience in:
* C/C++ programming
* Golang programming
* Python programming (language I teach about at University)
* Podman/Docker
* OpenShift/Kubernetes
* Software Design and Development
* Linux (especially RHEL)
* Scripting (especially Bash scripting)
* GIT (especially Github, Gitlab to a lesser extent)

I studied Telecommunication Engineering at [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/). Apart from that, I have a Software Craftsmanship Master's Degree also at [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/) and a Master's Degree in FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid](https://www.urjc.es/). I am also an Associate professor at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid](https://www.urjc.es/).

## NBDE
I mainly work on [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053). This technology is composed of different repositories. I usually collaborate with:
* [clevis](https://github.com/latchset/clevis)
* [jose](https://github.com/latchset/jose)
* [luksmeta](https://github.com/latchset/luksmeta)
* [tang](https://github.com/latchset/tang)

Apart from previous repositories, I am main developer and maintainer of `tang-operator`. This operator provides [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053), in particular, Tang server container deployment automation on [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift):
* [tang-operator](https://github.com/latchset/tang-operator)

Regarding tests, I usually collaborate with [RedHat Special Projects Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tests) upstream tests repository. I work mostly with [tang-operator suite](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tang-operator-tests)), although I have contributed to other test suites:
* [RedHat-SP-Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tests/commits?author=sarroutbi) / [tang-operator suite](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tang-operator-tests)

Lately, I have also been contributing to [DEE HMS](https://github.com/dee-hms/), an initiative to provide Disk Encryption Experience in [ConsoleDot](https://github.com/RedHatInsights). In particular, these are the repositories I have created and contributed to:
* [dee-hms-deployment](https://github.com/dee-hms/dee-hms-deployment)
* [socat-tang-filter](https://github.com/dee-hms/socat-tang-filter)
