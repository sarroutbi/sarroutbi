# Sergio Arroutbi (sarroutbi)

## Introduction
Hi there 👋. I am a passionate Software Engineer and Open Source Software advocate working at [Red Hat Inc.](https://www.redhat.com/)

I love [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) 🐧 Operating System and work mostly for [RHEL Operating System](https://www.redhat.com/es/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and [OpenShift Platform](https://github.com/openshift) ☸️. I also collaborate with [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) project.

Besides this, I work as [Associate professor](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/sergio.arroutbi) at [URJC (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid)](https://www.urjc.es/), where I teach different subjects related to network computer programming with Python, such as Socket programming, HTTP, JSON and REST APIs. I also started recently teaching Programming Fundamentals through Pascal programming language.

I mostly work on projects related to [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) (Network-Bound Disk Encryption), although recently I have started working on [Keylime](https://keylime.dev/) project, and, in particular, on [attestation-operator](https://github.com/keylime/attestation-operator) and [rust-keylime](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime) repositories. Lately, I have been also been playing around with [Konflux](https://konflux-ci.dev/), by migrating [nbde-tang-server](https://github.com/openshift/nbde-tang-server) to use this CI/CD system.

Previously, I have worked in different industries such as Information Technology, Telecommunications, Transport and Semiconductor industries, for companies such as [Telefónica](https://telefonica.es), [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com), [Motorola](https://motorola.com), [SepsaMedha](https://www.sepsamedha.com/), [Ericsson](https://ericsson.com) and [Marvell](https://www.marvell.com).

## Current Focus
At this moment, I am focused on:
* Implementation of Push Model for [rust-keylime](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Asarroutbi) repository
* Leading [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) efforts in on [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift)

## Technical Experience
I have experience in the following areas:
* C/C++ programming
* Control Version (mostly GIT, SVN to a lesser extent)
* Control Version Platforms (I love Github, but I can work with Gitlab as well)
* Document writing (through Latex and Markdown)
* Golang programming
* Keylime project
* Linux (especially RHEL and Fedora)
* Network Bound Disk Encryption
* Network programming 
* Object Oriented Programming
* OpenShift/Kubernetes, with experience on [operator development](https://github.com/openshift/nbde-tang-server)
* Podman/Docker
* Python programming (language I teach at University)
* Rust programming (to a lesser extent)
* Scripting (mainly through Bash)
* Software Design and Development
* Telco

I studied Telecommunication Engineering at [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/). 

I also have a Software Craftsmanship Master's Degree also at [Universidad Politécnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/) and a Master's Degree in FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid](https://www.urjc.es/).
