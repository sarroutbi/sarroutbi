# Sergio Arroutbi (sarroutbi)

Hello there üëã. I am a Senior Software designer and an Open Source Software advocate working at [Red Hat Inc](https://www.redhat.com/).

I love [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) üêß Operating System and work essentially for [RHEL Operating System](https://www.redhat.com/es/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and [OpenShift Platform](https://github.com/openshift). I also collaborate with [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) project.

I mostly work on projects related to [NBDE technology](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) (Network-Bound Disk Encryption), although recently I have started working on [Keylime](https://keylime.dev/) project, and, in particular, on [attestation-operator](https://github.com/keylime/attestation-operator) and [rust-keylime](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime) repositories.

In the past, I have worked in different industries such as Information Technology, Telecommunications, Transport and Semiconductor industries, for companies such as [Telef√≥nica](https://telefonica.es), [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com), [Motorola](https://motorola.com), [SepsaMedha](https://www.sepsamedha.com/), [Ericsson](https://ericsson.com) and [Marvell](https://www.marvell.com).

Additionally, I work as [Associate professor](https://gestion2.urjc.es/pdi/ver/sergio.arroutbi) at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid](https://www.urjc.es/), where I teach different subjects related to network computer programming with Python, such as Socket programming, HTTP, JSON and REST APIs.

I have experience in the following areas:
* C/C++/Golang programming
* Control Version (mostly GIT, SVN to a lesser extent)
* Control Version Platforms (I love Github, but I can work with Gitlab as well)
* Linux (especially RHEL and Fedora)
* Network Bound Disk Encryption
* Object Oriented Programming
* OpenShift/Kubernetes, with experience on [operator development](https://github.com/latchset/tang-operator)
* Podman/Docker
* Python programming (language I teach at University)
* Scripting (mainly through Bash)
* Software Design and Development

I studied Telecommunication Engineering at [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/). 

I also have a Software Craftsmanship Master's Degree also at [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/) and a Master's Degree in FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid](https://www.urjc.es/).
