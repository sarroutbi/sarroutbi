# Sergio Arroutbi (sarroutbi)

Hi there! üëã. I am a Software Developer working at [Red Hat Inc](https://www.redhat.com/).  I love [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) üêß Operating System and work essentially for [RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/es/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) Operating System, and in particular on projects related to [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) technology.

In the past, I have worked in different industries such as information technology, transport, telecommunication and services industries. Skilled in Linux, C/C++ and Golang programming, Shell Scripting, Software Design and Development, Docker and Kubernetes. I studied Telecommunication Engineering at [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/), and I have a Master's Degree in FLOSS (Free/Libre/Open Source Software) at [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid](https://www.urjc.es/) and also a Software Craftsmanship Master's Degree at [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](https://www.upm.es/).

## NBDE
I mainly work on [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053). This technology is composed of different repositories. I usually collaborate with:
* [tang](https://github.com/latchset/tang)
* [clevis](https://github.com/latchset/clevis)
* [jose](https://github.com/latchset/jose)
* [luksmeta](https://github.com/latchset/luksmeta)

Apart from previous repositories, I am main developer and maintainer of `tang-operator`. This operator provides `NBDE` technology, in particular, Tang server deployment automation on OpenShift/Kubernetes:
* [tang-operator](https://github.com/latchset/tang-operator)

Regarding tests, I usually collaborate with [RedHat Special Projects Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tests) (in particular, in [tang-operator suite](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tests/tree/master/tang-operator)) upstream tests repository:
* [RedHat-SP-Security](https://github.com/RedHat-SP-Security/tests/commits?author=sarroutbi)

I have also been collaborating with [DEE HMS](https://github.com/dee-hms/), an initiative to provide Disk Encryption Experience in [ConsoleDot](https://github.com/RedHatInsights). In particular, these are the repositories I have created and contributed to:
* [tang-adv-displayer](https://github.com/dee-hms/tang-adv-displayer)
* [dee-hms-deployment](https://github.com/dee-hms/dee-hms-deployment)

## Articles
I have written/co-written some articles, mostly on different aspects of [NBDE](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6987053) technology:
